# Setup

Getting started with the toolkit is relatively simple, but there are a few things you need to do to make sure you're ready to go.

## Step 1: Download Unity Hub.

- Assuming you do not already have a version of Unity to work with, you'll need to install Unity and the version of Unity the toolkit is built on. Navigate to https://unity.com/download and download Unity Hub for your platform of choice.

- From the same page at https://unity.com/download, visit the download archive.

-Within Unity Hub, install Version 2022.3.45f1. Select the platforms you anticipate building your game to in the future. (The screenshots are not comprehensive; review all the platforms you can build to in the installation wizard and select the ones you need.)

## Step 2: Clone the repo.

- This is pretty simple. Clone this repo using either GitHub Desktop (https://github.com/apps/desktop) or the Terminal or Command Line.
- In Unity Hub, select Add -> Add Project from Disk and navigate to where you cloned the SLRCore-Unity repo to. You can now use the toolkit locally.

## Step 3: Download the necessary packages.

## Step 4: Build your game.
